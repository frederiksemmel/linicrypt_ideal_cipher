  abstract="A wide variety of objectively practical cryptographic schemes can be constructed using only symmetric-key operations and linear operations. To formally study this restricted class of cryptographic algorithms, we present a new model called Linicrypt. A Linicrypt program has access to a random oracle whose inputs and outputs are field elements, and otherwise manipulates data only via fixed linear combinations.",
