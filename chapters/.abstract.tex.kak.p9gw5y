    This thesis is an exposition of the components that make up the proof of the Penrose Incompleteness Theorem, a geometric theorem in the field of general relativity.
    
   The theorem states, that geodesic completeness, global hyperbolicity, spatial non-compactness and the existence of a compact trapped surface are mutually exclusive in a spacetime where the null energy condition holds.
   Its importance lies in the fact that the existence of a trapped surface is a stable condition and thus, the formation of black holes is a robust prediction of general relativity.
