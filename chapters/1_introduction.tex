\chapter{Introduction}

In this thesis, we use the recently introduced Linicrypt model to revisit a set of well-known cryptographic constructions.
The goal is twofold:
On the one hand, we hope to increase our understanding of their security properties and the attacks on them.
On the other hand, we aim to improve and extend the Linicrypt framework.

\section{Background and Motivation}

It has been well studied that we can construct hash functions securely from block ciphers.
Moreover, since the success of very strong block ciphers such as AES, 
the trust in the security of modern block cipher constructions is very high.
Therefore, it makes sense to use a block cipher that is believed to be secure as a building block for other systems
and express their security in terms of the security of the block cipher.
The ideal cipher model, which Shannon introduced in \cite{Shannon49},
is a useful technique in this context.
This model assumes that the block cipher is a uniformly random permutation for any key.
Consequently, security properties can be proven in absolute terms, depending only on the number of queries an adversary makes to the ideal cipher.
The number of queries acts as a proxy for the time and resources needed to break the construction,
as we assume that the execution of the ideal cipher program has a fixed cost.

In a well-known paper from 1993 \cite{C:PreGovVan93}, the authors Preneel, Govaerts, and Vandewalle analyze the 64 most basic constructions of a compression function from a block cipher.
12 lead to secure hash functions in the \MD construction, including the Davies-Meyer compression function.
This construction is used, for example, in the popular hash function family SHA-2.
A follow-up paper by Black, Rogaway, and Shrimpton \cite{C:BlaRogShr02} in 2002 confirms these results
by providing tight security proofs in the ideal cipher model.
In addition, 
they find that 8 insecure compression functions of the 64 PGV constructions still lead to collision resistant \MD hash function constructions.

The PGV compression functions, as well as the \MD construction itself, consist of linear operations in a field,
mixed with calls to a primitive.
They are just two of many examples of this type of cryptographic construction.
The Linicrypt model was introduced by Carmer \& Rosulek \cite{C:CarRos16} to analyze such constructions at a higher level of abstraction.
The central idea of this proof model is the abstraction of a cryptographic construction from its program representation to an algebraic representation.

The Linicrypt framework has several benefits.
Firstly, attacks and security proofs work for a significant class of constructions at once.
It is easier to create a characterization for a given security definition at the algebraic representation level than at the program description level. 
Therefore, one can write proofs that work for all constructions that fulfill this characterization.
Secondly, characterizations can often be checked efficiently by a machine.
For example, in \cite{C:CarRos16},
two inputless Linicrypt programs were shown to be indistinguishable if and only if their algebraic representation are equivalent under a relation they define.
Another example is Theorem 1 from \cite{EPRINT:HolRosRoy22},
where authors describe a sufficient condition for a program to be IND\$-CPA secure in terms of its algebraic representation.
Both these characterizations can be computed in polynomial time.

\section{Our Contribution}

This thesis focuses on the results from \cite{TCC:McQSwoRos19} by McQuoid, Swope, and Rosulek.
They find a complete and sound characterization of collision resistance for a Linicrypt program
if the program uses only distinct nonces in its calls to a random oracle.
It turns out that collision resistance is equivalent to second-preimage resistance.
We replace the random oracle with an ideal cipher and adapt the algebraic representation accordingly.
Following the philosophy of the Linicrypt model,
we try to unify the proofs for both primitives.



To do so, we make a set of definitions that differ slightly in the case of the random oracle and the ideal cipher.
Some basic lemmas have to be proven separately for both cases, but their statements are identical.
Our characterization of the existence of a second-preimage attack is then expressed in terms of these lemmas.
This way, the characterization and proof for the attack work for both primitives simultaneously.
If a program fulfills our condition, we say it has a collision structure, following \cite{TCC:McQSwoRos19}.
But our more general definition of collision structure includes the case of degeneracy as an edge case,
which they had to treat separately.
Unfortunately, the security proof from \cite{TCC:McQSwoRos19} cannot be used directly in the ideal cipher model,
because a block cipher does not take a nonce as input.
Therefore, we restrict ourselves to single query constructions for our security proof.
The existence of a collision structure is then a complete and sound characterization of collision resistance and second-preimage resistance for single query constructions.

We then apply this ideal cipher based Linicrypt model to the 64 compression functions from \cite{C:PreGovVan93}.
We can derive an attack taxonomy for the \MD constructions using the new concepts based on these compression functions.
Such a derivation of the types of attacks was not given in the works mentioned above.
Our categorization for second-preimage attacks agrees mostly with the categories developed by \cite{C:PreGovVan93} and \cite{C:BlaRogShr02} for collision attacks.
However, we consider ours to be more fine-grained.
We could not find a second-preimage attack for 13 schemes.
8 of them have been proven to be collision resistant by \cite{C:BlaRogShr02},
hence also second-preimage resistant.
The remaining 5 are not collision resistant due to very particular collisions between different length inputs.
We suspect, however, that they are second-preimage resistant.

The high degree of geometric symmetry in the derivation,
the 5 remaining schemes and the schemes vulnerable to an input permutation attack point to possible future research on Linicrypt.
In particular,
a theorem about collision resistance and second-preimage resistance for general Linicrypt programs using repeated nonces should fill these gaps in the derivation.
Towards this goal, we identify two weaknesses a Linicrypt program with repeated nonces can have in addition to a collision structure.
The problem of collapsing queries has been briefly described in \cite{TCC:McQSwoRos19}.
Adding to this, we describe a permutation attack that can be carried out when the queries made by the program and its output follow a certain symmetry.
The permutation attack includes the attacks which permute the inputs but is not limited to them.
